This is my Python final project for my Data Science 4400 Machine Learning/Data Mining 1 class taken in Spring 2020.

This project is an exploration of using computer vision to detect skin cancer using real world datasets. Specifically this project used the HAM10000 dataset skin cancer dataset and tried to classify the images using various computer vision approaches.
